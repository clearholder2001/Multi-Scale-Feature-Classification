# Multi-Scale-Feature-Classification
This project, entitled "Remote-Sensing Image Classification Using Texture based Multi-scale Features", is aimed to improve classification accuracy with multi scale schemes. Semivariogram is performed to generate texture-based features from remote sensing images with different scales, and Support Vector Machine conducts image classification.
